title Face Detection and Recognition Program

participant "Main Loop" as ML
participant "Face Detection" as FD
participant "Face Recognition" as FR

database "Detection Buffer" as DB
database "Result Buffer" as RB
database "Recognition Buffer" as RB2
database "History Array" as HA

ML -> ML : capture a frame
ML -> DB : push the frame into detection buffer
DB -> FD : retrieve the frame from detection buffer
FD -> FD : run inference on the frame
FD -> RB : push the result to the result buffer of detection
RB -> ML : check if result buffer of detection have any items
alt result buffer of detection have items
ML -> ML : assign those frames to the tracker
ML -> ML : retrieve all tracks from tracker and crop the frame with the boxes from tracker
ML -> RB2 : push it to recognition buffer
RB2 -> FR : retrieve the cropped frame from the recognition buffer
FR -> FR : run inference on the cropped frame
FR -> FR : call a function called search name
FR -> HA : update the history array with the name of the recognized face
HA -> ML : retrieve the names from history array
ML -> ML : draw on the frame the boxes and write the names from history array
else result buffer of detection have no items
ML -> ML : do nothing
end
